# Screenshot Onboarding Audit

Status: product-spec reconstruction from the 52 supplied screenshots  
Dataset: `IMG_7569.PNG` through `IMG_7627.PNG` in numeric capture order  
Source dimensions: 1206 × 2622 px, consistent with a 3× 402 × 874 pt iPhone canvas

This is an observational specification, not authorization to copy Flo’s branding,
illustrations, writing, medical claims, or trade dress. The useful material is the
information architecture, adaptive behavior, and interaction patterns.

## Executive finding

The capture contains 38 onboarding/monetization screens followed by 14 downstream
product screens. The onboarding is not a simple setup wizard. It is a modular
assessment funnel:

1. establish identity and interests;
2. introduce a mascot-led “Well-Being Battery” promise;
3. collect cycle, symptom, sex, activity, body-measurement, and sleep context;
4. periodically show “analysis” interstitials and personalized result copy;
5. ask for a native permission only after explaining the benefit;
6. use a commitment interaction and celebration;
7. present a subscription paywall;
8. immediately demonstrate how the answers affect Today, logging, predictions,
   insight cards, and the Health Assistant.

The capture follows the “Charge my well-being” route. Other goal-specific routes
were not captured and must not be assumed to have the same questions.

## Question and answer taxonomy

### Identity and goal selection

| Field | Input model | Visible choices or behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Preferred name | Optional text | Skip available; greeting derives “Mann” from “Mann Bellani” |
| Birth year | Required-looking single wheel | Year values; 2007 selected |
| Interests/goals | Explicit multi-select | Get pregnant; already pregnant; track period; charge well-being; manage weight; enhance sex life; decode discharge; explore contraception |

The goal grid is interest-based rather than mutually exclusive. It likely controls which
chapters are added to the onboarding queue, while one reproductive state eventually
controls the primary Today mode.

### Cycle baseline

| Question | Cardinality | Visible answers |
|---|---|---|
| Are periods regular? | Single | Yes; No; I’m not sure |
| Last period start | Single date | Calendar day; I don’t remember |
| Birth control used | Single, skippable | Nothing; pill/patch/ring; progestin-only pill; implant/injection; hormonal IUD; copper IUD; condoms |
| Experienced health conditions | Multi, skippable | Yeast infections; UTIs; bacterial vaginosis; PCOS; endometriosis; fibroids |

The lists visibly continue below the viewport, so the screenshots do not prove that these
are the complete production option sets.

### Current symptoms and cycle signals

| Question | Cardinality | Visible answers |
|---|---|---|
| How do you feel today? | Multi | Cramps; fatigue; bloating; tender breasts; backache; none |
| Know that discharge changes? | Single | Yes; No |
| Cycle abnormalities | Multi | Unpredictable cycles; missed periods; heavy periods; spotting between periods; period shorter/longer than 2–7 days |
| Hormonal-imbalance signs | Multi | Acne/oily skin; excess facial/body hair; hair loss; unexplained weight gain/trouble losing; low libido |

The observed result groups the answers into two alert categories. It does not show a
condition diagnosis, but the language explicitly connects the signals with PCOS and
endometriosis and therefore behaves like a symptom-screening surface.

### Cross-domain cycle impact

| Domain | Cardinality | Visible answers/state |
|---|---|---|
| Sleep impact | Single | Yes; No; unsure; No selected |
| Skin impact | Single | Yes; No; unsure; Yes selected |
| Energy/activity impact | Single | Yes; No; unsure; No selected |
| Mental health impact | Likely multi | Mood swings; anxiety; fatigue; more below viewport; mood swings selected |

Selections are not just highlighted. The selected card becomes taller and injects a
domain-specific explanation and cross-sell for later content.

### Sex-life personalization

| Question | Cardinality | Visible answers |
|---|---|---|
| Want to change anything? | Not stated; appears single-choice | Better orgasms; improved sex drive; increased intimacy; sex positions; make sex less painful; nothing to change |
| Know how cycle relates to sex life? | Single | Yes; No; I don’t know |
| How to enhance sex life? | Not stated; appears single-choice | More connection; more orgasms; more fun; more confidence; prefer not to answer |

This module may feed premium sexual-wellness content or a Guided Journey. Exact skip
rules are not proven by the capture.

### Activity, body measurements, and sleep

| Field | Cardinality/input | Visible choices |
|---|---|---|
| Typical activity | Single | Not super active; some active breaks; on feet most of day; don’t track |
| Wearable | Single | None; Apple; Fitbit; Garmin; Other |
| Height | Numeric wheel | ft/in or cm |
| Weight | Decimal numeric wheel | lb or kg |
| Sleep goals | Explicit multi-select | Fall asleep faster; stay asleep; wake more rested; improve quality; improve bedtime routine |
| Motion & Fitness | Native permission | Don’t Allow; Allow |

### Commitment and monetization

| Field | Input | Visible choices |
|---|---|---|
| Commitment acknowledgement | Press and hold | Personalized pledge; radial progress implied |
| Subscription | Single plan/exit | Free trial; yearly plan; family plan; view all; restore; limited access |

The displayed prices are a point-in-time paywall experiment, not stable design tokens.

```

### Branch confidence

Observed directly:

- selected answer cards expand with personalized copy;
- unknown last-period state reaches a post-paywall empty Today screen;
- a newly logged period triggers prediction recalculation, an assistant prompt, period
  day states, and future ovulation states;
- activity, body measurements, and sleep follow the selected well-being route;
- limited access exists as a paywall exit.

Strongly inferred:

- selected goals enqueue or suppress assessment chapters;
- known last-period input seeds prediction history;
- selected symptom clusters determine the attention-result categories;
- “nothing to change” likely shortens the sex-life branch;
- wearable choice controls later integration prompts.

Not publicly proven by this dataset:

- the exact ordering and exclusivity rules when multiple goals are selected;
- the full pregnancy, TTC, weight, discharge, contraception, or perimenopause routes;
- whether height and weight are universal or goal-conditioned;
- whether a no-signal symptom response produces reassurance or silently skips results;
- which answer caused the native Motion & Fitness prompt;
- paid versus limited-access differences after the paywall beyond the visible screens.

## UI design system reconstructed from the screenshots

Approximate values are implementation guidance, not extracted brand assets.

### Visual tokens

| Token | Approximate value/use |
|---|---|
| Canvas | 402 × 874 pt logical mobile canvas |
| Brand coral | `#ff5b7d`–`#ff6281`; logo, CTAs, progress, active quick actions |
| Selected rose | `#ec607b`; filled answer cards |
| Pale blush | `#fff0f8`; assessment and story-map backgrounds |
| Neutral option | `#f3f3f3`; inactive choice cards and search |
| Surface | `#ffffff`; sheets, speech bubbles, option panels |
| Ink | near `#090909`; headings and high-priority labels |
| Muted ink | `#66666c`; helper text and inactive controls |
| Sleep aubergine | near `#302052`; sleep chapter atmosphere |
| Period wash | pale pink `#fbd6e2` family |
| Fertile wash | pale aqua `#c9eff0` family |
| Neutral-cycle wash | pale peach `#f8e7df` family |
| Warning | amber `#f5a900`; attention markers |
| Primary heading | bold rounded sans, approximately 28–32 pt, 750–850 weight |
| Body | rounded sans, approximately 14–17 pt |
| Helper/label | 11–14 pt, muted |
| Primary CTA | 50–56 pt high, pill radius, bold white label |
| Choice row | usually 54–72 pt high, 10–14 pt radius |
| Horizontal margin | usually 16–24 pt |
| Vertical rhythm | 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32 pt increments |

### Repeated patterns

1. **Progressive disclosure:** one question per screen; long option sets scroll.
2. **Back + progress + Skip:** thin progress bar without a numerical step count.
3. **Selected-card expansion:** selection changes color and reveals response copy.
4. **Mascot continuity:** the same character teaches, analyzes, celebrates, and links
   otherwise unrelated chapters.
5. **Chapter maps:** benefits are explained before more questions; future steps are shown
   as locked nodes.
6. **Analysis theater:** a brief animated pause separates data collection from a result,
   increasing the perceived value of personalization.
7. **Just-in-time permissions:** native permission appears after an explanation of why
   activity data is useful.
8. **Mixed CTA widths:** compact centered pills on choice screens; near-full-width CTAs
   on numeric pickers and paywalls.
9. **Centered questions, left-aligned answers:** prompts feel conversational while option
   lists stay scannable.
10. **State-colored Today canvas:** reproductive state changes the entire atmosphere, not
    merely an icon or badge.
11. **Horizontal insight rail:** the current state is decomposed into small, tappable
    content and metric cards.
12. **Sheet-based dense logging:** a separate neutral sheet contains the high-density
    tracker catalog, preserving a calmer Today screen.
13. **Commitment + celebration + paywall:** motivation is deliberately raised immediately
    before subscription choice.

### Accessibility and trust observations

- inactive and disabled text sometimes has low contrast;
- selection meaning depends heavily on color;
- analysis screens do not explain what is calculated or what data is retained;
- health-condition and symptom questions can feel diagnostic;
- claims connecting height/weight/activity to prediction quality need transparent evidence;
- the native permission prompt is well timed, but health-data consent and content
  personalization consent are not separately visible;
- the paywall uses a preselected yearly plan and visually de-emphasizes limited access.

## Comparison with current Lunara onboarding

Current Lunara flow:

1. privacy-first welcome;
2. single primary goal;
3. birth year;
4. last-period date;
5. typical cycle length;
6. optional OpenAI/Ollama configuration;
7. medical disclaimer and finish.

| Area | Screenshot flow | Current Lunara | Gap or deliberate difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity | Optional name + personalized greeting | No name | Missing optional personalization |
| Goals | Multi-interest grid; likely adaptive chapter queue | One mutually exclusive goal | Lunara cannot express secondary interests |
| Reproductive modes | Captured route is well-being; other routes not shown | Cycle, TTC, pregnancy, perimenopause | Lunara has an explicit peri mode advantage |
| Cycle baseline | Regularity, LMP, contraception, conditions | LMP + explicit typical cycle length | Lunara is simpler but lacks important context |
| Symptoms | Current symptoms and two signal screens | None during onboarding | No tracker personalization or baseline |
| Cross-domain impact | Sleep, skin, energy, mental health | None | Missing preference capture |
| Sexual wellness | Intent, knowledge, desired outcome | None | Deliberately avoid if Guided Journey remains excluded |
| Lifestyle | Activity level, wearable, height, weight | None | Missing import/personalization setup |
| Sleep | Goals + analysis | None | Missing preferences |
| Permissions | Just-in-time Motion & Fitness request | Health integration lives in Settings | Lunara has less onboarding friction but weaker discovery |
| AI | Proprietary “Intelligence” and assistant presented as benefit | Technical provider/model/key setup | Lunara is transparent but too implementation-oriented for a general-user funnel |
| Feedback | Multiple analysis and personalized-result screens | No intermediate payoff | Lunara feels like a form rather than a responsive conversation |
| Completion | Press-and-hold pledge + celebration | Read-and-confirm medical disclaimer | Lunara is safer and clearer, but less emotionally memorable |
| Monetization | Trial/yearly/family paywall + limited access | No subscription | Deliberate business-model difference |
| Visual language | Bold sans, mascot, blush maps, stateful cards | Editorial serif, mineral paper, botanical/orbital motifs | Preserve Lunara identity; borrow interaction structure only |
| Progress | Long modular flow with Skip on most sensitive questions | Fixed five-step setup header, excluding welcome and finish | Accurate for today’s linear flow, but not branch-aware |

### Lunara data-model readiness

Already persisted by onboarding:

- one primary `goal`;
- `birthYear`;
- pregnancy or cycle `lastPeriod`;
- estimated `cycleLength`;
- AI provider/model/base URL and secure API key.

Missing persistent onboarding fields:

- optional name;
- secondary interests;
- period regularity self-report;
- contraception method;
- baseline conditions;
- personalization preferences for symptoms, sleep, movement, and content;
- wearable brand;
- height;
- sleep goals;
- onboarding permission and consent states.

The existing daily-log taxonomy already covers many downstream tracker concepts:
symptoms, moods, discharge, sex, sleep, movement, wellbeing, contraception, care,
BBT, OPK, weight, water, steps, and notes. Notable visible gaps are the richer sex-event
set, pregnancy-test outcomes, several discharge variants, a height field, wearable
preference, and medication schedules.

## Recommended incorporation boundary

High-value, in-scope patterns to adapt:

1. optional name and a lightweight personalized greeting;
2. one primary mode plus secondary interests;
3. goal-conditioned chapters instead of one fixed sequence;
4. period regularity and contraception context;
5. a short, non-diagnostic “what would you like to track?” baseline;
6. selected-card explanations that immediately show why an answer matters;
7. chapter transitions using Lunara’s original botanical/orbital language;
8. just-in-time HealthKit/Health Connect education and permission;
9. a personalized setup summary before entering Today;
10. branch-aware progress and universal Skip/Prefer-not options;
11. keep AI setup optional, but move technical model/base-URL controls to Settings.

Explicitly excluded or unsafe to reproduce:

- PCOS/endometriosis or perimenopause symptom checking without a clinically validated,
  independently reviewed instrument;
- diagnostic-sounding “we detected” results;
- the Guided Journey and its orgasm-focused funnel if it remains out of scope;
- Secret Chats, community, Messages, and partner-sharing surfaces;
- Flo’s mascot, logo, illustrations, exact copy, paywall trade dress, or proprietary
  “Intelligence” claims.

The correct Lunara translation is a shorter, calmer, privacy-forward adaptive setup—not
a screen-for-screen clone.
